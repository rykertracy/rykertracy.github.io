This project is intended to help people (including myself) that have folders of many resumes from various job applications over the years to design resumes for specific job applications. The intention is to help users streamline their approach to job applications, especially with how stressful it can be for people suddenly finding themselves without employment.

Highlights:
- RAG Pipeline to pull from a knowledgebase of user resumes.
- Human-in-the-loop resume drafting.
- Extracting key insights related to a user's experience and a target job description.
