This project investigates **rate of penetration (ROP) prediction** using both classical supervised learning and deep learning techniques.  

Highlights:
- Collected real drilling datasets (petrophysical logs, indices).
- Built regression models to predict ROP.
- Experimented with **feed-forward neural networks** in PyTorch.
- Learned that ROP prediction benefits from **advanced neural network architectures**, not just basic supervised learning.
