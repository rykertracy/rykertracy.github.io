Iâ€™m using **GEMpy**, an open-source geomodeling library, to digitize old contour maps and create 3D geologic models.  

Highlights:
- Extracted contour lines from literature using Python scripts.
- Converted publicly available scanned maps into digital georeferenced data.
- Built initial stratigraphic surfaces in GEMpy.
- Goal: integrate borehole logs and seismic where available.
