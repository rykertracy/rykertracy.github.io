This project applies machine learning to **forecast hydrocarbon production** and **detect anomalies** in the United States.  

Highlights:
- Input features: rig count, weather data, drilling purchase price indices.
- Discovered weak correlations â†’ searching for richer datasets (well-level production, EIA reports).
- Next step: explore **transformer-based models** for time series forecasting.

ðŸ“ˆ **Status**: In Progress
